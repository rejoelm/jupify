## Executive Summary

JUPIFY is a GameFi-powered learning hub for Jupiter’s DeFi ecosystem, transforming complex on-chain products into bite-sized, interactive quests. By gamifying Spot trading, perpetual swaps, portfolio management, token verification, drip-farming, and mobile flows, we:

- **Eliminate onboarding friction** around wallets & UIs  
- **Flatten steep learning curves** with hands-on, simulated practice  
- **Boost engagement & retention** through rewards, NFTs, and social competition  

---

## Problem Statement

1. **Wallet & UI Friction**  
   - New users struggle with Solana wallet setup, test-net funding, and order-book interfaces.  
2. **Opaque Product Mechanics**  
   - Each Jupiter product has unique, undocumented workflows lacking guided tutorials.  
3. **Low Engagement & Churn**  
   - Without clear feedback loops or community drivers, users seldom progress beyond basic swaps.

---

## Solution Overview

JUPIFY reframes **learning as play**:

- **Interactive Quests**  
  Step-by-step missions replicate live flows in a risk-free, simulated DevNet environment.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**  
  Modules unlock progressively; AI-driven hints kick in after repeated failures.
- **On-chain Rewards**  
  Complete missions to mint JUP tokens and rarity-tiered NFTs on DevNet.
- **Social Competition**  
  XP leaderboards, seasonal “Seasons of Jupiter,” and badge collections.

## Architecture & Core Mechanisms

| Component              | Description                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**           | React/Next.js SPA with modular “quest portals,” mobile-responsive.                              |
| **Backend**            | Node.js microservices emitting mission events (`start`/`complete`).                            |
| **Wallet Integration** | Phantom adapter on DevNet with faucet for test SOL/JUP.                                         |
| **On-chain Rewards**   | Anchor programs mint JUP & NFTs based on mission events.                                        |
| **Analytics**          | Real-time progress tracking, adaptive hints logic, leaderboard engine.                          |
| **Auth**               | JWT + Solana wallet address as identity.                                                        |

## Module Breakdown

### 5.1 Spot Trading & JUP Pro

- **Objective:** Master limit orders, market orders, stop-losses.  
- **Mechanism:** Simulated order book challenges (e.g., maintain tight spreads).  
- **Rewards:** XP, JUP tokens for volume thresholds, “Market Maker” NFT badge.

### 5.2 Perps & Edge

- **Objective:** Understand funding rates, margin, liquidation.  
- **Mechanism:** Scenario puzzles (e.g., funding-rate shocks), multiple-choice actions.  
- **Rewards:** XP per scenario, JUP drip proportional to PnL, “Perpetual Pro” NFT.

### 5.3 Portfolio Management

- **Objective:** Build & rebalance diversified portfolios.  
- **Mechanism:** Drag-and-drop asset allocation with time-accelerated simulations.  
- **Rewards:** Continuous JUP drip for target-band maintenance, “Balanced Builder” NFT.

### 5.4 Token Verification & Drip

- **Objective:** Complete KYC-lite quizzes & drip-farming tutorials.  
- **Mechanism:** Interactive quiz → verify JUP mint on chain → mint small JUP.  
- **Rewards:** JUP airdrops, “Verified Voyager” NFT.

### 5.5 Enjoyoors & Mobile Onboarding

- **Objective:** Learn deposit, withdrawal, bridging on mobile.  
- **Mechanism:** Tap-through mockups → “Go Live” toggle after full completion.  
- **Rewards:** XP, priority access to live drip pools, “Mobile Master” NFT.
